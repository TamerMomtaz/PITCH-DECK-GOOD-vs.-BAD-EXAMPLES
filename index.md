**Problems:**
- Too much text - audience will READ, not LISTEN
- No visuals
- Boring
- Presenter will just read from slide

**What You Say:**
"RootRise is an AI-powered platform that transforms SMEs in three simple steps. First, we diagnose your entire business in 48 hours - what would take consultants two months. Then we generate a customized roadmap in one week. Finally, we guide you through implementation over three months. What used to cost €100,000 now costs €3,000."

**Why This Works:**
- Simple visual shows the process
- Audience LISTENS to you, not reading slide
- Key point is clear (1/30th the cost)
- You add the details verbally

### **PROBLEM SLIDE**

❌ **BAD:**
```
Problems Facing Egyptian SMEs Today:

### **MARKET SLIDE**

❌ **BAD:**
```
Market Opportunity Analysis:
• Total Addressable Market (TAM): The total addressable
  market consists of all 2.5 million SMEs in Egypt across
  all sectors and industries, representing approximately
  €2.5 billion in annual spending on business consulting
  and transformation services

### **TRACTION SLIDE**

❌ **BAD:**
```
Current Business Traction and Achievements:
We have successfully completed our pilot program with
several customers who have provided positive feedback.
Our initial pilots included businesses from various
sectors including manufacturing and services. Based on
the results, we are seeing strong interest from other
potential customers in the market. We expect to continue
growing our customer base in the coming months as we
scale our operations and expand our sales efforts...

## 🎯 THE KEY DIFFERENCES

### **Bad Slides:**
- Lots of complete sentences
- Paragraphs of text
- Presenter reads from screen
- Audience zones out
- No visuals
- Boring
- Too much detail

### **Good Slides:**
- Big headlines
- 3-5 bullet points MAX
- Strong visuals
- Presenter tells story
- Audience stays engaged
- Memorable
- Just enough detail

---

## 📝 FORMULA FOR EACH SLIDE

```
1. BIG HEADLINE (what this slide is about)
   ↓
2. VISUAL (image, chart, diagram, icon)
   ↓
3. 3-5 KEY POINTS (short bullets)
   ↓
4. ONE BOTTOM LINE (key takeaway)
```

**Then YOU add the magic through narration**

---

## 🎤 HOW TO PRESENT

### **For Text-Heavy Current Slides:**

**Option 1: SUMMARIZE**
"I know there's a lot on this slide, but the key point is this: [one sentence summary]. Let me break it down..."

**Option 2: HIGHLIGHT**
"You can read the details later, but I want to focus on these three things: [point to key items]..."

**Option 3: REBUILD** (Recommended)
Remove 80% of text, keep visual highlights, tell the story verbally

---

## ✅ QUICK TEST

**Show your slide to someone for 3 seconds, then hide it.**

**Can they tell you:**
- What the slide was about?
- What the key number/stat was?
- What the main point was?

**If NO → Too much text**  
**If YES → Good slide**

---

## 💡 SLIDE MAKEOVER PROCESS

**Your colleague should do this for each slide:**

1. **Read the current slide**
2. **Ask: "What's the ONE key point?"**
3. **Make that the headline (big and bold)**
4. **Pick 3-4 supporting stats/facts**
5. **Add a visual (image, icon, chart)**
6. **Delete everything else**
7. **Write what you'll SAY in speaker notes**

## 📱 EXAMPLE: BEFORE & AFTER

### **BEFORE (Current Slide):**
```
"Our business model is based on a subscription-based 
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approach with three distinct 
pricing tiers designed to accommodate different customer 
needs and budgets. The entry-level Diagnostic tier is 
priced at €500 per month and includes access to our AI-
powered diagnostic assessment tools and automated roadmap 
generation. The mid-tier Advisory package costs €1,500 
monthly and adds quarterly consultations with our expert 
advisors as well as priority support. Our premium 
Transformation tier at €3,000 per month provides 
comprehensive hands-on support throughout the entire 
transformation journey with weekly check-ins and dedicated 
account management."

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What You Say:**
"We offer three tiers. Diagnostic at €500 for DIY. Advisory at €1,500 with expert support. Transformation at €3,000 for full hands-on guidance. Compare that to €100,000+ for traditional consulting."

**Savings:**
- Reduced from 95 words on slide to 12 words
- Added visual comparison
- Made pricing instantly clear
- Kept the story for narration

## 🎯 TELL YOUR COLLEAGUE:

### **Three Rules:**

1. **"If I can read it, you don't need to say it"**
   - Slides = visual highlights
   - Voice = full story

2. **"One slide, one idea"**
   - Don't try to cram everything
   - Keep slides focused

3. **"Less is more"**
   - Cut 70% of text
   - Add visuals
   - Trust your voice

### **Action Steps for Her:**

1. Go through current deck
2. For each slide, ask "What's the ONE key point?"
3. Reduce text to 3-5 bullets maximum
4. Add a visual (image, icon, chart)
5. Write full story in speaker notes
6. Practice saying it out loud
7. If she's reading from slides → still too much text

### **The Goal:**

- Slides that a 10-year-old could understand in 3 seconds
- Story that engages investors for 12 minutes
- Questions that show genuine interest

---

**Bottom line: Slides are billboards, not documents. You drive by billboards at 60mph - they need to be simple and clear!**

*Send this to your colleague along with the full pitch deck template. She'll understand exactly what to do.*
